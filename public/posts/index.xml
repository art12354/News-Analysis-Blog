      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-two-states-of-america-what-don-bacons-potential-ouster-could-reveal&#34;&gt;The Two States of America: What Don Baconâ€™s Potential Ouster Could Reveal&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In his landmark 1941 analysis &lt;em&gt;The Dual State&lt;/em&gt;, German political theorist Ernst Fraenkel described the inner workings of Nazi Germany as divided between two overlapping spheres: the &lt;em&gt;normative state&lt;/em&gt;, governed by laws and civil institutions, and the &lt;em&gt;prerogative state&lt;/em&gt;, where arbitrary power, unchecked by legal restraint, was used to suppress dissent and enforce ideological loyalty. While America today is far removed from the conditions of Nazi Germany, moments arise that raise uncomfortable questions about whether a shadow prerogative state is developing alongside our democratic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
